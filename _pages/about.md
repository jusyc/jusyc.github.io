**Welcome!** I am a fifth year graduate student studying theoretical computer science in the Electrical Engineering and Computer Science department at MIT. I am very happy to be advised by [Piotr Indyk](https://people.csail.mit.edu/indyk/).

I think about the intersection of **algorithm design**, **data analysis**, and **machine learning**. Recently, I have been interested in optimizing repeated computations (*learning-augmented algorithms*), designing algorithms which hide individuals' sensitive information (*differential privacy*), and analyzing data with limited memory (*streaming and sketching algorithms*).

During my PhD, I have been fortunate to work with [Morteza Zadimoghaddam](https://research.google/people/mortezazadimoghaddam/), [Alessandro Epasto](https://www.epasto.org/), and [Vincent Cohen-Addad](https://www.di.ens.fr/~vcohen/) at Google Research and [Nina Mishra](http://theory.stanford.edu/~nmishra/) and [Tal Wagner](https://www.mit.edu/~talw/) at AWS. Previously, I was an undergrad at Stanford University and had the great pleasure of working with [Greg Valiant](https://theory.stanford.edu/~valiant/) and [Peter Bailis](http://www.bailis.org/). It all started in Hanover, New Hampshire with [Chris Polashenski](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=J_AqH3wAAAAJ&hl=en) at the Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory.

Feel free to reach out to me at {first 4 letters of first name}{first letter of last name}@mit.edu.
