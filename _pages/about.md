**Welcome!** I am a fourth year graduate student studying theoretical computer science in the EECS department at MIT. I am very fortunate to be advised by Piotr Indyk.

I like in problems at the intersection of algorithms, data analysis, and machine learning. Recently, I have been interested in optimizing repeated computations (e.g., algorithms with predictions), streaming and sketching algorithms, and differential privacy.

Before coming to MIT, I was an undergrad at Stanford University and had the great pleasure of working with Greg Valiant and Peter Bailis. It all started in Hanover, New Hampshire with Chris Polashenski at the Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory.

Feel free to reach out to me at {first 4 letters of first name}{first letter of last name}@mit.edu.
