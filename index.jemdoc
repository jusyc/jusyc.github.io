== Welcome!

I am a PhD student in my final year at MIT. I study computer science in the [https://toc.csail.mit.edu/ Theory of Computation Group]. I am very happy to be advised by [https://people.csail.mit.edu/indyk/ Piotr Indyk].

I think about problems at the intersection of *algorithm design* and *machine learning*. Recently, I have been crafting algorithms which (1) interact with powerful but untrustworthy AI models (/learning-augmented algorithms and LLM evaluation/), (2) are stable to small changes in their inputs (/differential privacy and replicability/), and (3) efficiently learn with as little data and compute as possible.

During my PhD, I have been fortunate to be supported by the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship and MathWorks Engineering Fellowship and to work at Google Research and AWS. I was an undergrad at Stanford University and had the great pleasure of working with [https://theory.stanford.edu/~valiant/ Greg Valiant] and [http://www.bailis.org/ Peter Bailis]. It all started in Hanover, New Hampshire with [https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=J_AqH3wAAAAJ&amp;hl=en Chris Polashenski] at the Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory.

Feel free to reach out to me at {first 4 letters of first name}{first letter of last name}@mit.edu.

I am looking for postdoc positions starting in Fall 2026!
